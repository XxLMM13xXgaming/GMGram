config.ServerID = "69" -- This is your servers id that you are given...

config.Password = "P@SSW0RD" -- Please change this

config.CooldownTime = 5 -- Time in min for the cooldown to post photos

-- LINKS WILL BE CHANGING SOON!
config.TakeCodeFromInternet = true -- Should we take code/text from the internet
-- If you dont feel safe then you can turn this to false however it will remove some pretty cool features!
-- What this does..
-- It gets some info text found in the !gmgram menu
-- It grabs filters

-- NOTE: The code is ONLY ran client side no serverside functions will be called!

-- The links used..
-- https://gist.githubusercontent.com/XxLMM13xXgaming/570411a1a6085baec8924ebc86a63065/raw/GMGramInfo The info page
-- https://gist.githubusercontent.com/XxLMM13xXgaming/69a30fa87d6cacd803b40c64e1116ef7/raw/GMGramFilters The filters page
-- Feel free to check all those links out!

-- Well why do you need to upload code?
-- One of the features of GMGram is filters... Now this feature will allow me to make them whenever i want (for special events)
-- So if its X-Mas time i can make a X-Mas theme filter and right after X-Mas i can just remove it :D
-- Now no filters are available when this option is turned off because i fix + add these all the time and its just easy to have them auto update

-- When updates happen i will add some basic filters however special filters will need the config.TakeCodeFromInternet to be enabled!
